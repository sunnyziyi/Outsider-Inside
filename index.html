  This project started in February 2020, the time that Chinese people struggled with COVID-19. Rao mainly focuses on peopleâ€™s reaction to the virus, rather than the illness itself. The stories in the drawings are based on true events, relating to people, medical staff, and government, that happened during the virus in China. Rao now stayed in the US, so she is an outsider who observed the virus in China. However, she is also an insider because her family and people she cared about is in the center of this epidemic. Therefore, she represents her view of this event as neither insider nor outsider.
